"address, User ID and date of birth.\n"
"\n"
"Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the "
"dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts "
"displayed prior to the Data collection.\n"
"\n"
"Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, "
"collected automatically when using this Application.\n"
"\n"
"Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is "
"mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for this "
"Application to provide its services. In cases where this Application "
"specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to "
"communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the "
"functioning of the Service.\n"
"\n"
"Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome "
"to contact the Owner.\n"
"\n"
"Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by "
"the owners of third-party services used by this Application serves the "
"purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any "
"other purposes described in the present document and in the [cookie policy](/"
"cookie-policy).\n"
"\n"
"Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published "
"or shared through this Application and confirm that they have the third "
"party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.\n"
"\n"
"-------------------\n"
"\n"
"## Mode and place of processing the Data\n"
"\n"
"### Methods of processing\n"
"The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized "
"access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.\n"
"\n"
"The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, "
"following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the "
"purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be "
"accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the "
"operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, "
"system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical "
"service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, "
"communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the "
"Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at "
"any time.\n"
"\n"
"### Legal basis of processing\n"
"The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the "
"following applies:\n"
"\n"
"- Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: "
"Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data "
"until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to "
"rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, "
"does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to "
"European data protection law;\n"
"- provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with "
"the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;\n"
"- processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which "
"the Owner is subject;\n"
"processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest "
"or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;\n"
"- processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests "
"pursued by the Owner or by a third party.\n"
"\n"
"In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis "
"that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of "
"Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement "
"necessary to enter into a contract.\n"
"\n"
"### Place\n"
"The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other "
"places where the parties involved in the processing are located.\n"
"\n"
"Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring "
"the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find out more about "
"the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the "
"section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.\n"
"\n"
"Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to "
"a country outside the European Union or to any international organization "
"governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, "
"such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to "
"safeguard their Data.\n"
"\n"
"If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the "
"relevant sections of this document or inquire with the Owner using the "
"information provided in the contact section.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"### Retention time\n"
"Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the "
"purpose they have been collected for.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore:\n"
"\n"
"- Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a "
"contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such "
"contract has been fully performed.\n"
"- Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate "
"interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. "
"Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests "
"pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by "
"contacting the Owner.\n"
"\n"
"The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period "
"whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such "
"consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain "
"Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the "
"performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.\n"
"\n"
"Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. "
"Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to "
"rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after "
"expiration of the retention period.\n"
