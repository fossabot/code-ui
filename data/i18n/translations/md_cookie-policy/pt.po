"## What Are Cookies\n"
"\n"
"As is common practice this application uses cookies, which are tiny files "
"that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page "
"describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes "
"need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these "
"cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain "
"elements of the sites functionality.\n"
"\n"
"For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on HTTP "
"Cookies.\n"
"\n"
"## How We Use Cookies\n"
"\n"
"We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in "
"most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies "
"without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this "
"site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure "
"whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that "
"you use.\n"
"\n"
"## Disabling Cookies\n"
"\n"
"You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your "
"browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling "
"cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that "
"you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain "
"functionality and features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended "
"that you do not disable cookies.\n"
"\n"
"If you are logged in, you can opt-out from the analytics cookies (described "
"below) in the Account Settings section of your profile page.\n"
"\n"
"### The Cookies We Set\n"
"\n"
"#### Necessary Cookies\n"
"\n"
"If you create an account with us then we will use cookies for the management "
"of the signup process and general administration. These cookies will usually "
"be deleted when you log out however in some cases they may remain afterwards "
"to remember your site preferences when logged out.\n"
"\n"
"We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. "
"This prevents you from having to log in every single time you visit a new "
"page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log out to "
"ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in."
"\n"
"\n"
"To know what programs you have saved locally and what parts of the interface "
"you are currently using we use cookies. Without that data the interface "
"cannot work correctly.\n"
"\n"
"All the necessary cookies are installed in the local storage of your browser "
"(so they are actually not technically \"cookies\").\n"
"\n"
"### Third Party Cookies\n"
"\n"
"In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. "
"The following section details which third party cookies you might encounter "
"through this site.\n"
"\n"
"#### Analytics Cookies\n"
"This site uses Google Analytics which is one of the most widespread and "
"trusted analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how you "
"use the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These cookies may "
"track things such as how long you spend on the app, the parts of the "
"interface you use or if you have any errors so we can continue improving the "
"interface.\n"
"\n"
"Here is a detailed description of the third party cookies that are used:\n"
